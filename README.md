# Tech This Out
A CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.
This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Installation/Usage
The application is accessible through the deployed URL, where users must first be created and then posts can be created through the registeres user.

If you prefer to use the application locally:

Run the following commands in your terminal/command-line to initialize database:

* `mysql -u root -p `

* password

* `source db/schema.sql`

* `npm start`

Open your browser to http://localhost:3001/.
